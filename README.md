# Body signal of smoking ðŸš¬
Performance comparison between traditional machine learning and deep learning.

## Summary:
1. For this task, Traditional ML model is better than MLP, and we look at the Traditional ML result, the best Traditional ML is ExtraTreesClassifier (90.89 Â± 0.42), 3.63 sec time but MLP (58.63 Â± 1.65), 13.10 sec. The model that achieves state-of-the-art performance depends on the problem, available datasets. So a comprehensive comparison between traditional ML models and deep neural networks is not appropriate for this website, because it requires a lot of time and space.
2. The best Traditional ML is ExtraTreesClassifier (90.89 Â± 0.42), 3.63 sec time and XGBClassifier (90.28 Â± 0.13), 1.87 sec.
3. Recall score of data with feature is better than with no features selection process but a little.
4. Data show different method of dealing with unbalanced dataset like smoking and non-smoking. Use undersampling technique method to handle. The response variable can lead to better than no imbalanced data.

## Introduction
Smoking has been proven to negatively affect health and complex behavior. This project is binary classification task, classify the presence or absence of smoking through bio-signals.
